# SignedPerms
Signed permutations.

A  signed permutation of `1:n` is  a permutation of the set `-n,…,-1,1,…,n`
which  preserves the  pairs `(-i,i)`.  It is  represented internally as the
images of `1:n`, and is printed as a product of signed cycles.

The group of signed permutations of `1:n` is called the hyperoctaedral group.

This package implements these notions.
